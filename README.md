# Introduction

This repository contains scripts and other contents to get personal workstations up and running in no time.

It is often cumbersome to recover all necessary applications and tools after a fresh installation of Windows. So I decided to write some scripts that help me recover my workstation state to what I am used to. Most of the applications are installed via [chocolatey](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco), an awesome package manager for Windows.
